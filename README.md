# Leetcode-Solutions
This repository contains answers to all the Leetcode and GFG questions I've solved!

My Leetcode Profile: https://leetcode.com/AbhideepGhosh/

I started my interview prep a few months back, as notes, I created a repo, where I kept all of my optimized solutions which I came up while attempting the questions again and again or by refering to videos online.
Well, considering I will be updating this Repo almost everyday with the questions I solve, I think it would be of best use to make it available publicly.

For Searching A Specific Question, the best way would be to press Ctrl + F(Search Word In Browser) and type the exact name of the question without spaces with first letter of every word in caps.

I hope this repo would be of help for your interview preps! All the best for your preps and keep working hard ðŸ˜Š
